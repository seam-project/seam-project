# Project Description

## What problems does the project solve

### Timetabling

- A university can have different lecture halls with different capabilities, capacities and purposes.
- It can also have students that are taking different combination of courses.
- Therefore, an intelligent solution is required so as to optimize the usage of halls and period times.

## Techniques used to obtain information

We represent our understanding of the project using the integrated metamodel[^integrated-metamodel]
for program comprehension.

### Timetabling

- Establish a partial top-down model for the timetabling UniTime component using the
[provided documentation on the component](https://www.unitime.org/uct_courses.php).

- Refine the top-down model by running the application locally, logging in with a guest account,
and testing the !!TODO functionality
