Alternatively, use JavaSource/org/unitime/timetable/gwt/services/SectioningServiceAsync.java listClasses()
to obtain the data
    - JavaSource/org/unitime/timetable/gwt/server/SectioningServlet.java listClasses()
    - It requires StudentSectioningContext, what is that? Create it and set its properties

How pages in gwt are assigned
    - JavaSource/org/unitime/timetable/gwt/client/Pages.java where page name is enum name

Two decisions for showing student scheduling info on clicking
    - Either to create a new action and JSP and get the scheduling info from the database
    - Or create a new GWT page and use SectioningService to get the scheduling info
